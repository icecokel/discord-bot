# Project Rules

## General

1. **Rule Compliance**: Must strictly follow Global/Workspace Workflows, Skills, and Rules.

## Command Implementation

1. **Case Insensitivity**: All English commands must handle input case-insensitively (e.g., `!Ping` = `!ping`).
2. **Korean Aliases**: Every command must have at least one Korean alias (e.g., `!ping` -> `['!ping', '핑']`).
